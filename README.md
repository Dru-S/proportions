## Project setup and build

```sh
npm install

npm run serve # For development, with hot-reload
npm run serve # For production, with minify

## `// TODO:`

- [ ] Refactor some code
- [ ] Add `localStorage` to save and restore some settings
- [ ] Add option to print the result without trailing zeros, if the results is an integer
- [ ] Maybe think also about mobile devices
