## Project setup and build

```sh
npm install

npm run serve # For development, with hot-reload
npm run serve # For production, with minify
```

## `// TODO:`
- [ ] Refactor some code - _Always doing..._
- [ ] Add `localStorage` to save and restore some settings
- [ ] Add option to print the result without trailing zeros, if the results is an integer
- [x] Maybe think also about mobile devices
- [ ] Grid & Inline view
- [ ] `copy-btn`, to copy the result (and maybe a snackbar or an alert to notify)
- [ ] Better management of button styles, maybe a class to style'em all!
